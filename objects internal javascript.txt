     object:

            In javascript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type.
   
     Compare it with a cup, for example.  A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material

     it is made of etc.  The same way, Javascript object cn have properties, which define their characteristics.


    Creating Objects in Javascript:

    1. By object literal

    2. By creating instance of object directly(using new keyword)

   
    By object literal:

    The syntax of creating object using object liternal is given below:

   object={property1:value,property2:value2......protertyN:valueN}


   prperty and value is separated by colon(:).


  Example:
      
         Var person={
         fname:"xxx",
         lname:"yyy",
         age:25
         };


  By creating instance of object directly(using new keyword):

   The systax of creating object directly is given below:


            Var objectname=new Object();

   Here, new keyword is used to create object.

  Example:

           Var emp=newObject();
           emp.id=101;
           emp.name="xxx";
           emp.salary=50000;

   Accessing Javascript object:

      The syntax for accessing the prepertpy of an object is:


      objectName.property


     or


     objectName["property"]

    Accessing 'fname' from example 1 sing dot opertor,



                    person.fname


    Accessing 'name' from example 2 using [],



          emp["name"]
